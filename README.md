# verilog_i2c
Simple Verilog I2C library using the MPU9250/5 series IMU as a test-platform and example. This is not generalized for any i2C read/write, but simply a proof-of-concept of how one goes about interfacing.  This was developed using a Nexys 4 board.  Will add detailed notes/exaple wiring eventually (5/24/2017)
